Streams Examples
================
This repository contains 'ready-to-run' community-supported example applications built on Apache Streams (incubating).

These examples demonstrate some ways you can use various streams components and runtimes, and patterns for testing and documenting your organization's streams.

Note
====

The Streams Examples project itself (this one) depends on the separate Streams project, which contains the source code and poms for Apache Streams.
    
Releases of streams-project are published to the Apache Releases repository, so there is typically no need to check it out manually and build it locally yourself.

However, you may want to work from a SNAPSHOT branch and/or alter the versions of dependency libraries, please refer to the Tutorial steps at http://streams.incubator.apache.org to build streams-project and streams-examples.
